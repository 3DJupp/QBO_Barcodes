Barcodes of the QBO Capsules


I scanned the barcodes of a few QBO Capsules for the QBO-Coffeemaker 
My intent is to understand how the capsules are recognised.
This is done via QR / Barcodes 

The following capsules i currently have here:
R = Cleaning capsule (Reinigung)

AM=Alta Mogiana
BEN=Buna Enteta
ESP=Estrada Paraiso
VAN=Volcanes Antigua
BBB=Baba Budan

Espresso:
SRY=Sidama Royal
